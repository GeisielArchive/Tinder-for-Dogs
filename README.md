# TinDog

In this project, the goal is to create a landing page using the Bootstrap framework that will showcase the mobile app "TinDog," a "Tinder" designed specifically for dogs. The main idea is to apply the knowledge acquired during the bootcamp in HTML and CSS to develop a responsive and visually appealing web page.
